# SemaphoresWithPthreads
This program revolves around the concept of the producer consumer concept using concurrency. This program is able to run different threads at the same time. 

This emphasizes the concepts of mutual exclusion, bounded waiting, progress, and race conditions using semaphores. The semaphores in this project enable the program to satisfy all these concepts with the use of the semaphores functions post and wait to allow each thread run efficiently without any conflictions.
